## Definitions

Df. An integer `n` is even if it can be written as `n = 2k` for some integer `k`.

`n` is even ↔ ∃ k ∈ Z s.t. n = 2k

DF. An integer `n` is odd if it can be written as `n = 2k + 1` for some integer `k`.

n is odd ↔ ∃ k ∈ Z s.t. n = 2k + 1

n is prime ↔ n > 1 ∧ (∀ r, s ∈ ℕ, n = rs → (r = n ∨ s = n))

n is composite ↔ n > 1 ∧ (∃ r, s ∈ ℕ s.t. n = rs ∧ 1 < r < n ∧ 1 < s < n)
