## Divisibility

DF. Let n, d be integers with d ≠ 0
	Then n is divisible by d if ∃ k ∈ Z s.t. n = kd

Ex. 12 is divisible by 4, because where k = 3, n = kd

Notation, d | n means "n is divisible by d," or "d divides n"

## Euclidean GCD

Greatest Common Divisior: Given integers a, b, the GCD of a, b is the greatest integer d s.t. d / a && d / b

One method of finding this is to multiply all the primes that they share:
EX: GCD(66, 24)
	66's primes are 2x3x11, 24's primes are 2x2x2x3. Their GCD is 2x3 = 6.

#### Euclidean

Theorem: GCD(a, b) = GCD(a, b-a)

EX: (66, 24)
(42, 24)
(18, 24)
(18, 6)
(12, 6)
(6, 6)
6 = 6
